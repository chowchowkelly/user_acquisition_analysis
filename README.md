# Objective:

The hypothetical app provides job matching services based on users’ personalities. The company is optimizing for collecting as many user personality data as possible by having users to complete Myers Briggs personality tests. The project should be completed within 2 hours.

## Goal: 
optimize user acquisition through online advertisement strategies. 

## Solution:
- understanding location strategy based on different metrics like lowest user acquisition and lowest user acquisition + high data quality
- measuring user engagement by evaluating the outcome of a new feature
- understanding the relationship between user engagement and user referrals

## Findings:
- Sometime, the country with very low acquisition costs has users that don’t like to provide high data quality. For example, Japan is the top 4th most expensive country to acquire users. However, it is also the top 4th cheapest country to acquire users who tend to help maintain good data quality (aka complete the most quizzes).
-  Ever since they registered, they have used the new ‘check fit’ feature at least once a day on average. 
- Out of all the registered users, about 89.4% of users have completed the first quiz (start providing data / using the app). Surprisingly, there is no correlation between completing the first quiz and inviting friends to download the app. Given the incentive structure of the app (you get “virtual tokens” by both inviting friends and completing tests), perhaps some people find it more effortless to acquire virtual tokens by inviting friends than giving out their personality data. Either way is helpful for growing the app’s user base. 



### About the data:
Each column of the data is either a user trait or a user action. All
the columns starting from "registration" to "join a team" are user
actions. The the values are the number of times a user completed the
action.
